    <h2 class="calibre1" id="section-12">12 Conclusions</h2>

    <p class="calibre1">We have argued that <em>complexity</em> causes more problems in
    large software systems than anything else. We have also argued that it <em>can</em>
    be tamed — but only through a concerted effort to <em>avoid</em> it where
    possible, and to <em>separate</em> it where not. Specifically we have argued that a
    system can usefully be <em>separated</em> into three main parts: the <em>essential state</em>,
    the <em>essential logic</em>, and the <em>accidental state and control</em>.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">We believe that taking these principles and applying
    them to the top level of a system design — effectively using different
    specialised <em>languages</em> for the different components — can offer more in terms
    simplicity than can the unstructured adoption of any single general language
    (be it imperative, logic or functional). In making this argument we briefly
    surveyed each of the common programming paradigms, paying some attention to
    the weaknesses of object-orientation as a particular example of an
    imperative approach.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">In cases (such as existing large systems) where this
    <em>separation</em> cannot be directly applied we believe the focus should be on
    avoiding state, avoiding explicit control where possible, and striving at
    all costs to <em>get rid of code</em>.</p>

    <p class="calibre1">So, what is the way out of the tar pit? What is the
    silver bullet? . . . it may not be FRP, but we believe there can be no doubt
    that it is <em>simplicity</em>.</p>
